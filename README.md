# Raspberry-PiHole
This project is to create a Pi-Hole on Raspberry Pi I have been working on at school.

A Pi-Hole is an ad blocker and it prevents the device from connecting with the ad server. This will either eliminate ads altogether or cause the ads to be blank error screens. To complete this project it will need Micro sd, Raspberry Pi, and cables (ethernet and dongle). The purpose of this project is to learn more about Pi-Holes and hopefully create a successful one to block ads on my devices.
